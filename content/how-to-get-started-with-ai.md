# Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly evolving field that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This guide provides a foundational understanding of AI and how to get started.

## Why Study AI?

AI is transforming various industries by automating complex tasks, improving efficiency, and enabling new innovations. Knowledge of AI can lead to opportunities in fields such as data science, robotics, and autonomous systems.

## Key Areas of AI

1. **Machine Learning (ML)**: Algorithms that allow computers to learn from data and make predictions.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Techniques for enabling machines to understand and respond to human language.
3. **Computer Vision**: Technologies that enable machines to interpret and process visual information from the world.

## Getting Started with AI

1. **Learn the Basics of Python**: Python is widely used in AI due to its extensive libraries and simplicity.
2. **Explore AI Libraries**: Familiarize yourself with libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and PyTorch.
3. **Understand Key Concepts**: Study foundational concepts like neural networks, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning.

## Writing Your First AI Program

Here’s a simple example using Python’s Scikit-Learn library to create a basic machine learning model:

```python showLineNumbers
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Create and train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
